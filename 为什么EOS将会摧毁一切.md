Why EOS will destroy everything else
Simply by seeing 2018 is not 2009.

## 为什么 EOS 将会摧毁一切（改变历史）
*现在已经是 2018 年，而不是 2009 年了*



What’s happening with “blockchain” right now has already happened in computing. Is similar to what happened with A.I. R&D in the 1980’s. Namely, the widespread development of tech whose massive level of sophistication (which implies higher costs) is irrelevant for the market. That cheapening is a thing that happens to all commercial industries as they mature across decades of competition. But, in “blockchain,” a decade fits in a year or two.

“区块链”行业现在正在发生的事情已经是预料之中的事。这类似于 A.I.R&D 在 20 世纪 80 年代的情况。换句话说就是，这类高度复杂技术的广泛发展（这意味着更高的成本）是与市场无关的。它们在数十年的竞争市场中逐渐成熟，表现在所有商业行业其价格趋于下降。但是，在“区块链”行业中，一年或两年就可以抵得上其它行业十年的路。

Bitcoin was the product of the cypherpunks. These are, essentially, the “only the paranoid survive” crowd, the “the government is watching” crowd. It would be only natural they would come up with a solution to the double-spending problem that involves an open peer-to-peer network of anonymous nodes. They tuned it for maximum resilience against a concerted attack from the global money cartel and the governments they exert massive control over.

比特币是数字朋克们（ cypherpunks ）的产物，而数字朋克们基本上是“只有偏执狂才能生存”以及“政府正在关注”一个群体。他们找到解决双重支付问题的方案是很自然的，这个问题涉及到一个开放的匿名的点对点网络。但他们不得不做好准备，以应对来自全球货币联盟和各国政府强大控制中的共同攻击。


( Remember when the creator(s) of Bitcoin hid under the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym, and when Wikileaks wanted to use Bitcoin for donations, Nakamoto freaked out, stating that it was “too early” and that the network could have been killed by a massive surge in usage (and also in attention from the powers-that-be) so early in its development? That mentality would have never though something like EOS would be sufficient to run an anarchic money system?—?not even after the success of Bitcoin. )


（众所周知比特币的创造者是中本聪，而当维基解密（ Wikileaks ）想要使用比特币进行捐赠时，中本聪吓坏了，发表声明说现在“太早”了，发展早期的比特币网络可能会被大幅增加的使用量所压垮（同时也受到上文说到那些反对势力的关注），那么这种心态永远不会像 EOS 那样，足以运行一个无政府状态的货币体系，即使在比特币成功之后也是如此）


Besides its prohibitive costs of operation, borne out of the need to spread a global ledger across ten thousand consumer-grade anonymous nodes, the Bitcoin protocol worked. With its global bandwidth of 3 transactions per second, not only it worked as a demo, as a proof that anarchic money exists and is possible to build, but it gathered a global cult following that, at its peak, valued the Bitcoin network at about $340,000,000,000.


除了其令人望而却步的运营成本之外，在 Bitcoin 工作协议下，其需要通过在全球一万个消费级匿名节点上传播账本。而它在全球范围内每秒处理3笔交易，这不仅仅是作为一个演示（ demo ），也作为无政府货币*存在*和可能创立的证据，因此在这之后，全球范围内掀起了一股热潮，在其顶峰时，它的网络价值达到了 3400 亿美元（译者注：比特币目前市值 7400 亿美元，占市场总市值的 45% ）。



People have then slowly walked back from the paranoia of the cypherpunk mentality. Bitcoin’s security requirements are maximal, e.g. requiring every transaction to be broadcast to and processed by every single node, so several projects have started by questioning that excessive level of security, hoping to find attack vectors they can afford to discard in order to reap some performance gains.

后来，人们慢慢地从数字朋克（cypherpunk）那种盲目崇拜的情绪中走了出来。比特币的安全需求成为了头等大事，例如，要求每笔交易都要广播到每个节点，且每个节点都要进行处理，因此有不少项目开始质疑这种过度的安全性，希望找到他们可以承受的一些边界（ attack vectors ）以获得某些性能提升。


In early 2018, the main word is now “scale.” The vast majority of blockchain projects are competing for the transactions-per-second crown, while offering other perks like e.g. secure user identification (NEO). And several of the scaling proposals are, in my opinion, needlessly complex, because they cargo-cult insist on the cypherpunk requirement of a sprawling peer-to-peer network of nodes?—?in many cases, still regular home broadband nodes.

 2018 年初，市场的关键词是“规模”。绝大多数区块链项目都在追求谁的交易处理速度更快，同时还提供其它的辅助功能，例如，安全的用户身份识别（ NEO ）。但在我看来，这是不必要且复杂的，因为他们固执的坚持认为一个庞大的点对点网络节点是数字朋克的要求——在许多情况下，一般的家庭宽带就够了。

Projects like EOS and Lisk come from a different angle: they assume there will be very few full nodes in a blockchain network, and these will be “super-peers.” EOS, in particular, realizes that there is no need to hold back at all, and states: we will have 20 highly-stable, highly-public (known), highly-funded companies worldwide, organized as a token ring overlay network, and they will take quick three-second turns each being the leader and having its massive clusters issuing blocks to the other super-peers. It will have a bandwidth that’s only limited to what computers and networks can do.

像 EOS 和 Lisk 这样的项目其考虑的角度是不同的：它们假设区块链网络中将会有非常少的完整节点，并且这些节点将是“超级节点”。尤其是， EOS 意识到根本没必要阻止超级节点，同时声明：我们将在全球范围内拥有20家高度稳定和知名，且资金雄厚的公司，形成一个令牌（ token ）环形覆盖网络，他们将以三秒确认一次的方式轮流成为领导者，并通过大规模集群协作向其它超级节点发放数据块。它将有一个仅限于计算机和网络可以执行操作的带宽。


EOS, like Bitcoin, works. But EOS is massively cheaper. However, EOS would probably not have “worked,” as a social phenomenon, if it was Satoshi Nakamoto’s project. The cypherpunk paranoia story was effective in uprooting the psychological domination of the current State-based, cartel money system, because first it validated its massive power (which is reified?—?considered real, concrete, unassailable?—?in most people’s minds all around the globe), and then it offered a bunch of technically unnecessary but psychologically compelling reasons for why it was going to defeat that powerful global monopoly on money creation and operation.

EOS 像比特币一样有效。但是 EOS 更便宜。然而，如果它是中本聪的项目，EOS 作为一种社会现象可能不会“有效”。赛博朋克盲目崇拜的故事有效地推翻了目前基于国家的卡特尔货币体系（ cartel money sytem ）（这被认为是真实的，具体的，无懈可击的——在全球大多数人的脑海中），然后它提供了一堆*技术上不必要的东西，但理论上令人信服的*理由，即为什么它要颠覆这种现行的全球货币发行方式的原因。


If EOS came first, maybe the EOS site operators?—?the block producers?—?could have been legally persecuted. No one would have really known who they were or what they were trying to achieve. But now? Now “crypto”?—?Internet-based, computer-based anarchic money creation and operation?—?is a thing, and the persecution and destruction of any such network is now impractical, in case it was not always impractical, which is also a possibility.

如果 EOS 先于比特币出现，也许 EOS 节点——区块生产商——可能会受到法律上的困扰。因为没有人真正知道他们是谁或他们想要达到什么目标。但现在呢？现在的“加密”——基于互联网，基于计算机的一种无政府状态的货币创造和运行是一件即成的事情，同时现在对任何此类网络形式的迫害和破坏都是不切实际的，但也要防止黑天鹅情况的发生，这种可能性一直都存在。

The power of the global money cartel system?—?the Euro, the Dollar, etc. all these “different” currencies which are not different at all but local branches of the same debt-based global currency, controlled by a handful of “banking” corporations?—?is purely psychological. Like any religion, it is powerful only to the extent people think its dominance is unassailable. Before Bitcoin, it was unthinkable that someone could “create money”?—?that sounds criminal… like… smoking a plant! After Bitcoin, that power is significantly crippled. Now people all around the globe know that the idea that there can only be “one money” is a complete farce. The Religion is shown to be non-total, because now people know that there are many Religions to choose from and that, in fact, people are free to worship the token of their choosing and the State should not at all interfere, nor be able to violently impose their own token and persecute and torture those who don’t agree with it.

全球货币卡特尔体系的构成——欧元，美元等所有这些意识形态上的“不同的”货币，除了基于同一全球货币债务的本国货币外，这些货币完全没有区别，都是由少数“银行”机构控制 。就像任何宗教一样，只有当人们承认它的支配地位是无懈可击时，它才是强大的。比特币出现之前，如果你听说有人可以“创造金钱”，你觉得这是不可思议的，这听起来像犯罪......就像......吸食毒品！比特币出现之后，这种力量明显减弱了。现在全世界的人都知道，只能有“一种货币（ one money ）”的想法是一场彻头彻尾的闹剧。宗教被证明也不是唯一的，因为现在人们知道有许多宗教可供选择，事实上，人们可以自由地崇拜他们选择的 token ，国家根本不应该干涉，也不能暴力的强加他们自己的 token ，并打击报复那些不同意的人。

The One True Money story no longer works. Attempting to persecute operators of money networks will not stick?—?not all around the globe, across States, all at once, which is what is required to destroy something like EOS. We can, should and must create different moneys. In 2018, we have sufficiently advanced a worldview of monetary diversity. That is what has changed between 2009 and 2018. That is what Bitcoin has accomplished.

一个真正的货币故事将不再有效。试图破坏货币网络的经营者将难以生存下去——不是在全球范围内，而是在各个州，这是摧毁像EOS这样的东西所需要的东西。我们可以，应该且必须创造不同的货币。在 2018 年，我们已经充分推进了货币多元化的世界观。这就是 2009 年到 2018 年之间发生的变化，这也正是比特币所取得的成就。

The overzealous and tilted craft, and thus the ballooning costs of the “golden age” phase of an industry all arise from that process of social story development that is inherent in any kind of industry. Early social preoccupations are fulfilled, then dropped for later, more optimized preoccupations. Some american cars from the 1950’s were gorgeous and sturdy, but had no seat belts. The kind of craft seen in the golden age of movies and video-games (depth) has given way to other kinds of craft (instant gratification), etc.

过度热忱和豪华工艺，以及行业“黄金时代”阶段的泡沫成本都来自其发展进程中，这是任何一种行业都会有现象。在实现早期的社会关注后被放弃，直至优化迭代浴火重生。一些 1950 年代美国的汽车豪华且坚固，但没有安全带。在电影和电子游戏的黄金时代（深度）看到的那种工艺已经让位于其它类型的工艺（即时满足）等等。

And thus, as we see that the religion of Debt Money and its devil are all invented, we realize it has no power over us. The power that myths have over a society depend on accepting that myth as at least partially real. We have all seen way too many spy movies. Thus, if we want a new digital money, we can merely set up a decent amount of social replication world-wide, across a significant number of State jurisdictions (and let’s not forget to add back-up replicas, just in case!), and let each replica be a business, thus optimizing to the actual architecture of the computer network known as “Internet,” which is optimized for the client-server, producer-consumer distinction, and also to the actual architecture of human society, where businesses concentrate a few specialists that maintain services for users who don’t really have to know much about how it works.

因此，正如我们所看到的，货币债务及其魔鬼般的宗教都被创造了出来，我们意识到它没有凌驾于我们之上的能力。神话故事对社会的影响取决于这种神话故事有多少部分是真实的。我们看过很多谍战影片。因此，如果我们想要一个新的数字货币，我们可以在全球范围内建立一个相当数量的协作关系，可跨越多个州的司法管辖区（我们不要忘记保存副本，以防万一！），并让每个 replicas 成为一项业务，从而优化被称为“互联网”的计算机网络的实际架构，该架构针对客户端服务器，生产者与消费者的差异以及人类社会的实际架构进行优化，那里的企业集中了一些专家，为那些真正不需要知道如何工作的用户提供服务。



There’s more to the design of EOS that I like, such as the governance features, the social safety net (recover the funds you misplaced by calling a friend), and the transparent inflation mechanism used to replace the unusable ritual of calculating transaction fees (though tiny, invisible fees will still be needed as a spam-prevention measure, I believe). But the main thing about EOS is the realization that you can’t really do much better in terms of cost reduction and increased bandwidth and latency than using specialized hardware and Grid Computing (the cousin of “clould” that isn’t foggy). I’m not sure what Lisk and other similar projects with 20 to 100 block producers are planning to do, but EOS has, to me, the largest, most public commitment to performance and the strongest display of dropping the cargo-cult of Bitcoin design paranoia?—?which had its usefulness in 2009, but no longer in 2018.

我更喜欢的 EOS 设计，比如治理功能，社交安全网络（通过邀请朋友来找回你遗失的资金），透明的通胀机制用来取代计算交易费用（尽管很少，但预防垃圾邮件的潜在的费用还是需要的，我相信），但是关于 EOS 最主要事情是认识到，与使用专用硬件和网格运算（ Grid Computing ）相比，在降低成本以及增加带宽和延迟方面，你无法做得更好。我不确定的是， Lisk 和其它类似的项目通过 20 到 100 个区块生产者打算做什么。但是对我来说， EOS 对其性能有最大的、最公开的承若，同时这也是放弃对比特币设计盲目崇拜的最强烈的表现。这种盲目崇拜在 2009 年有用，但现在是2018年。


In short, we have three types of blockchain networks in operation or in development:

总之，我们有三种类型的区块链网络正在运行或正在开发中：

-  EOS-like systems: maximum performance, minimum cost;

类似 EOS 系统：最大的性能，最低的成本；

Ethereum-like systems: work as social insurance for the EOS-like systems, supplies extra security for those niche applications that need it more than low latency and high bandwidth;

类似以太坊系统：作为类似 EOS 系统的社会保险，为那些需要更多低延时和高带宽的小众应用提供额外的安全性;




- Bitcoin-like systems: museum artifacts.

类似比特币系统：去历史博物馆吧。


The Ethereum-like and EOS-like systems are not really in competition, in the sense that we don’t want one to destroy the other. We need both systems. However, “EOS” (really, EOS-like systems) will “destroy” everything else because they will capture most of the market, the same way all the smaller e-mail services vanished, and everyone uses either Gmail now or some e-mail dinosaur product that their employers have pushed on them. Why use something slow, expensive and complicated to operate, when the user can have something fast, cheap and simple?—?something that’s actually more secure, because the actual weak link in security is not “the evil government and the hackers” but the user or, to be precise, the user not having a clue about what they are doing? 

类似以太坊和 EOS 的系统并不是所谓的竞争关系，也就是说，我们并不希望其中一个打败（消灭）另外一个。二者我们都需要。然而， “EOS” （事实是，类似 EOS 系统）将会“消灭”其它所有东西。因为它们将会占领大部分市场，就像所有小型电子邮件服务消失了一样，现在每个人要么使用 Gmail 要么使用其雇主推送给他们的一些落伍的电子邮件。为什么要使用不仅很慢很昂贵且复杂的操作，当用户能够使用快速便捷且简单的东西时——这实际上更安全。因为在安全方面真正的薄弱环节不是“政府和黑客作恶”，而是用户，或准确的说是用户不知道他们自己在做什么？，

Finally, I’m not sure the EOS project specifically will be able to deliver. EOS is run by humans, and humans are fallible. But I do believe that a consortium blockchain works incomparably better than a “pure peer-to-peer” blockchain when we have a directly democratic (or the anarcho-capitalist approximation of that, by way of money-based voting) control of who exactly belongs in that consortium.

最后，我不确定 EOS 项目能否真正落地实现。 EOS 是由人设计的，而人类很容易犯错误。但是我确实认为，当我们拥有直接民主（或者近似于无政府资本主义，通过基于 money 的投票方式）来管理谁应该属于哪个联盟时，联盟区块链的作用比“纯粹的点对点”区块链要好得多。

EOS is also the best-funded software project in history. They literally have billions to develop their product.

EOS 是迄今为止开发资金最为充分的软件项目。根据其众筹来看，他们有数十亿美元用于开发他们的产品。
